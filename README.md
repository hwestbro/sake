# Sake


### What is it?
Sake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows with 
intricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the 
instructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of the 
project's workflow. The first time it's run, sake will build the whole 
project in an order that automatically satisfies all dependencies. For all 
subsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the parts of the project that depend 
on changed files. This cuts down on unnecessary re-building and letâ€™s you 
concentrate on your work rather than memorizing the order in which commands 
have to be run.

Sake is free, open source software under a very permissive license (MIT Expat)
and is written in python.
