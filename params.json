{"name":"Sake","tagline":"A self-documenting build automation tool","body":"### What is it?\r\nSake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows with intricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the instructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of the projects' workflow. The first time it's run, sake will build the whole project in an order that automatically satisfies all dependencies. For all subsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the parts of the project that depend on changed files. This cuts down on unnecessary re-building and letâ€™s you concentrate on your work rather than memorizing the order in which commands have to be run.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\n### The rules\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're having trouble using sake; have a question; or want to contribute, please email me at tony.fischetti@gmail.com","google":"UA-46395813-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
