{"name":"Sake","tagline":"A self-documenting build automation tool","body":"### What is it?\r\nSake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows with \r\nintricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the \r\ninstructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of the \r\nprojects' workflow. The first time it's run, sake will build the whole \r\nproject in an order that automatically satisfies all dependencies. For all \r\nsubsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the parts of the project that depend \r\non changed files. This cuts down on unnecessary re-building and letâ€™s you \r\nconcentrate on your work rather than memorizing the order in which commands \r\nhave to be run.\r\n\r\nSake is free, open source software under a very permissive license (MIT Expat)\r\nand is written in python.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### The rules\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're having trouble using sake; have a question; or want to contribute,\r\nplease email me at tony.fischetti@gmail.com\r\n","google":"UA-46395813-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
