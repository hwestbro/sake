{"name":"Sake","tagline":"A self-documenting build automation tool","body":"### What is it?\r\nSake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows with\r\nintricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the\r\ninstructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of the\r\nproject's workflow. The first time it's run, sake will build all of the\r\ncomponents of a project in an order that automatically satisfies all\r\ndependencies. For all subsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the parts\r\nof the project that depend on _changed_ files. This cuts down on unnecessary\r\nre-building and lets the user concentrate on their work rather than memorizing\r\nthe order in which commands have to be run.\r\n\r\nSake is free, open source cross-platform software under a very permissive\r\nlicense (MIT Expat) and is written in Python.\r\n\r\nQuick links:\r\n* [Example](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/#example)\r\n* [Installation](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/#installation)\r\n* [How do I use it?](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/#documentation)\r\n* [Support or contact](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/#support-or-contact)\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nConsider this example workflow that examines correlates of DUI arrests with various adolescent-related data by state.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\n# Macros\r\n#! TEEN_STATS_URL=http://mathforum.org/workshops/sum96/data.collections/datalibrary/US_TeenStats.XL.zip.xls\r\n\r\nfetch teen stats:\r\n    help: fetches various teen statstics from the web\r\n    # no dependencies\r\n    formula: >\r\n        curl -o teenstats.xls $TEEN_STATS_URL;\r\n    output:\r\n        - teenstats.xls\r\n \r\nformatting:\r\n    help: formatting and conversion steps\r\n    convert teen stats to csv:\r\n        help: uses gnumerics ssconvert to convert ugly xls to csv and cleans it\r\n        dependencies:\r\n            - teenstats.xls\r\n            - convert.sh\r\n        formula: >\r\n            ./convert.sh;\r\n        output:\r\n            - teenstats.csv\r\n    format dui stats:\r\n        help: format raw (copy and pasted) dui/state data using perl\r\n        dependencies:\r\n            - rawdata.txt\r\n        formula: >\r\n            perl -pe 's/^(\\D+)\\s+([\\d,]+)\\s+([\\d,]+)\\s*/\\1\\t\\2\\t\\3\\n/'\r\n            rawdata.txt | sed 's/,//g' > duistats.tsv;\r\n        output:\r\n            - duistats.tsv\r\n \r\nfind correlates:\r\n    help: calls R script that finds correlates of DUI arrest in various teen statistics\r\n    dependencies:\r\n        - duistats.tsv\r\n        - teenstats.csv\r\n        - dui-correlates.R\r\n    formula: >\r\n        ./dui-correlates.R\r\n    output:\r\n        - Rplots.pdf\r\n        - lmcoeffs.txt\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an Sakefile to build/document a process that processes and formats two data files from the web and feeds it into an R script that searches for correlations and, ultimately, produces an output table and a graphic.\r\n\r\nThe entire process can be performed, start to finish by running the following command:\r\n```\r\nsake\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mandatory \"help\" fields are used internally by sake to produce the following output when \r\n```\r\nsake help\r\n```\r\nis run:\r\n```\r\nYou can 'sake' one of the following...\r\n\r\n\"find correlates\":\r\n  - calls R script that finds correlated of DUI arrest in various teen statistics\r\n\r\nformatting:\r\n  - formatting and conversion steps\r\n\r\n    \"convert teen stats to csv\":\r\n      -  uses gnumerics ssconvert to convert ugly xls to csv and cleans it\r\n    \"format dui stats\":\r\n      -  format raw (copy and pasted) dui/state data using perl\r\n\r\n\"fetch teen stats\":\r\n  - fetches various teen statstics from the web\r\n\r\nclean:\r\n  -  remove all targets' outputs and start from scratch\r\n\r\nvisual:\r\n  -  output visual representation of project's dependencies\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, a visual representation of the dependency diagram can be produced, automagically, by running the following command\r\n```\r\nsake visual\r\n```\r\nWhich produces the following image![Automagic dependency visualization](http://www.onthelambda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/graphviz.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a really simple example, sure, but it's easy to see that, even for the most labyrinthine of pipelines, that a visualization like this can really help get a sense all the actions involved in a workflow. The key points here are (a) that no extra effort had to be expended by the operator/writer of the workflow to generate 'help' and visualization of dependencies, and (b) that the documentation of the workflow occurs _as a result_ of designing and writing it.\r\n\r\nThe coupling of writing the automation and documentation makes sake a sound choice for\r\n* Scientists that want to share their scientific workflow with other researchers. Sake helps facilitate open science and reproducibility.\r\n* Data analysts with steps in their pipeline that take hours or days to finish running.\r\n* Business teams that want to share and visualize workflows amongst its members, even\r\nif they are using different computing platforms.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThis project has four dependencies:\r\n - Python 2.7, or above\r\n - The python module, networkx\r\n - The python module, PyYAML\r\n - Graphviz\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install sake is via pip.\r\n\r\nAssuming you have python and easy_install installed, just run:\r\n```\r\n[sudo] easy_install pip\r\n[sudo] pip install networkx\r\n[sudo] pip install pyyaml\r\n[sudo] pip install master-sake\r\n```\r\nOS-specific instructions are available in the documentation linked to below\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nPDF documentation may be accessed [here](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/sake-doc.pdf)\r\n\r\nHTML documentation may be accessed [here](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/sake-doc.html)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're having trouble using sake; have a question; or want to contribute,\r\nplease email me at tony.fischetti@gmail.com","google":"UA-46395813-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
