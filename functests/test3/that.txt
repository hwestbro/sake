                        sake quiet build full          passed

THIS WAS THE OUTPUT:
You can 'sake' one of the following...

"build binary":
  - uses the object files and compiles the final qstats binary

"compile objects":
  - compile all c files into object files

    "compile graphfuncs":
      -  compiles the graphing functions

    "compile infuncs":
      -  compiles the input functions

    "compile qstats driver":
      -  compiles the qstats driver c program

    "compile statfuncs":
      -  compiles the statistics functions

"ensure version match":
  - this is to ensure that the version from qstats.c matches the version in the html output

"generate html documentation":
  - uses pandoc to generate html documentation from markdown

"output wrapper":
  - this is a wrapper around 'output version text file' to appropriately test the entire API

    "output version text file":
      -  this is a silly target that outputs the qstats version ascii-art printed, it is needed to test the whole API

"package it":
  - takes the final binary and documentation and puts it in a tarball

clean:
  -  remove all targets' outputs and start from scratch

visual:
  -  output visual representation of project's dependencies
