NOTES:
a help message is mandatory
if no formula then its meta
meta-targets should have nothing but help and atom targets

get url
put source url in lib/constants
look at /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages and populate
fields missing from the egg info
check if metatarget has atomtargets
check if all has unrecognized target
issue warning if target all is missing
yaml parse accepts duplicate values
¿can meta-targets be nested?
duplicates are a sign of a really really big bug
¿tests?
docs man file

?no target may be names help or visual
fix command line visual call
Sakefiles need globbing support
